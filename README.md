# Unnoficial Raspberry Pi Godot Engine

Unnoficial [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) editor binaries and export templates for the Raspberry Pi.

All the binaries are compiled on a Raspberry Pi 4, following the [official documentation for compiling Godot in Linux](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/compiling_for_linuxbsd.html).

The scons parameters used to compile both the editor and the export templates are a mix between [FRT](https://github.com/efornara/frt) by [@efornara](https://github.com/efornara/) and this [blog post](https://bits.p1x.in/raspberry-pi-4-as-perfect-indie-console/) by [@w84death](https://github.com/w84death/).

```
scons platform=x11 target=release_debug tools=yes use_llvm=yes CCFLAGS="-mtune=cortex-a72 -mcpu=cortex-a72 -mfloat-abi=hard -mlittle-endian -munaligned-access -mfpu=neon-fp-armv8" -j 4
```

*The lines above are used to compile the editor. To compile the export templates, use `target=release` and `tools=no`*.

**NOTES**:

- Currently only the Raspberry Pi 4 is supported.
- Godot 2.1.6 is the only version of the editor that runs perfectly on the Raspberry Pi 4. Greater versions (>= 3.1.x) do work, but they are very laggy.
- Godot 3.0.x versions don't work at all because they don't support GLES2, only GLES3, and the Raspberry Pi doesn't support GLES3. That's why those version aren't here.

## How to run the editor

To open the editor, run:

```
./godot_x.x.x_rpi4_editor.bin
```

*(where `x.x.x` is the version of Godot)*.

You might need to give executable permissions to the binary. If that's the case, run:

```
sudo chmod +x godot_x.x.x_rpi4_editor.bin
```

## How to use the export templates

### Godot 2.x

- In the editor, go to `Export`.
- Select the `Linux/X11` template.
- In `Debug`, uncheck `Debugging Enabled`.
- In `Custom Binary -> Release`, select the version of the export template that matches the version of your project.
- In `Binary`, uncheck `64 bits`.
- Click `Export`.
- You can use the `.rpi4` extension when naming the exported game.

### Godot 3.x

- In the editor, go to `Project -> Export`.
- Select the `Linux/X11` template.
- In `Binary Format`, uncheck `64 bits`.
- In `Custom template -> Release`, select the version of the export template that matches the version of your project.
- Click `Export Project`.
- Uncheck `Export With Debug`.
- Optionally, after the game is packed, you can rename the extension of the game's executable binary from `.x86` to `.rpi4` to avoid confusion.

## How to run a game

If the `.pck` file is compiled in the executable binary or it has the same name as the executable binary and they are both in the same directory, you can just run the executable binary.

```
./name_of_your_godot_game.ext
```

If the `.pck` file has a different name or it's in a different directory than the executable binary, or you are using an independant `.pck` file, you'll have to pass its path using the `--main-pack` option.

```
# Using your own exported binary.
./name_of_your_godot_game.ext --main-pack "/path/to/the/pck/file.pck"

# Using the export template binaries from this repository.
./godot_x.x.x_rpi4_export-template.bin --main-pack "/path/to/the/pck/file.pck"
```
