# Unnoficial Raspberry Pi Godot Engine

Unnoficial [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) editor and export templates binaries for the Raspberry Pi.

All the binaries are compiled and tested on a non-overcloked **Raspberry Pi 4 4GB** running [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/), following the [official documentation for compiling Godot in Linux](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/compiling_for_linuxbsd.html).

The scons parameters and flags used to compile both the editor and the export templates are a mix between [FRT](https://github.com/efornara/frt) by [@efornara](https://github.com/efornara/) and this [blog post](https://bits.p1x.in/raspberry-pi-4-as-perfect-indie-console/) by [@w84death](https://github.com/w84death/).

```
scons platform=x11 target=release_debug tools=yes use_llvm=yes CCFLAGS="-mtune=cortex-a72 -mcpu=cortex-a72 -mfloat-abi=hard -mlittle-endian -munaligned-access -mfpu=neon-fp-armv8" -j4
```

*The scons parameters above are used to compile the editor. To compile the export templates, `target=release` and `tools=no` must be used*.

**NOTE**:

Currently only the Raspberry Pi 4 is supported.

## Editor

### Support and downloads

|  | 2.1.6 | 3.0.6 | 3.1.0 | 3.1.1 | 3.1.2 | 3.2.0 | 3.2.1 | 3.2.2 | 3.2.3 | 3.2.4 beta 4 |
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Status | &#x2713; | &#x2717; | * | * | * | * | * | * | * | &#x2713; |
| Download | URL | &#x2717; | URL | URL | URL | URL | URL | URL | URL | URL |

- âœ“: Works perfectly.
- âœ—: Doesn't work.
- \*: It works, but it's laggy/unresponsive at fullscreen (1920x1200). Making the editor 1/2 or 1/3 of that size makes it run better.

### How to launch the editor

To open the editor, run:

```
./godot_x.x.x_rpi4_editor.bin
```

*(where `x.x.x` is the version of Godot)*.

You might need to give executable permissions to the binary. If that's the case, run:

```
sudo chmod +x godot_x.x.x_rpi4_editor.bin
```

## Export templates

### How to use the export templates

**NOTE**:

You don't have to use a Raspberry Pi to export a game for it. You can use any computer running any OS supported by Godot.

#### Godot 2.x

- In the editor, go to `Export`.
- Select the `Linux/X11` template.
- In `Debug`, uncheck `Debugging Enabled`.
- In `Custom Binary -> Release`, select the version of the export template that matches the version of your project.
- In `Binary`, uncheck `64 bits`.
- Click `Export`.
- You can use the `.rpi4` extension when naming the exported game.

#### Godot 3.x

- In the editor, go to `Project -> Export`.
- Select the `Linux/X11` template.
- In `Binary Format`, uncheck `64 bits`.
- In `Custom template -> Release`, select the version of the export template that matches the version of your project.
- Click `Export Project`.
- Uncheck `Export With Debug`.
- Optionally, after the game is packed, you can rename the extension of the game's executable binary from `.x86` to `.rpi4` to avoid confusion.

## Exporting a PCK file

You can just export a `.pck` file and run it with the export templates in this repository.

### Godot 2.x

- In the editor, go to `Project -> Export`.
- Select the `Linux/X11` template.
- In `Binary Format`, uncheck `64 bits`.
- Click `Export PCK/Zip`.
- Enter the name of your game with the `.pck` extension.
- Click `OK`.

### Godot 3.x

- In the editor, go to `Project -> Export`.
- Select the `Linux/X11` template.
- In `Binary Format`, uncheck `64 bits`.
- Click `Export PCK/Zip`.
- Uncheck `Export With Debug`.
- Enter the name of your game with the `.pck` extension.
- Click `Save`.

## How to run a game

If the `.pck` file is compiled in the executable binary or it has the same name as the executable binary and they are both in the same directory, you can just run the executable binary.

```
./name_of_your_godot_game.ext
```

If the `.pck` file has a different name or it's in a different directory than the executable binary, or you are using an independant `.pck` file, you'll have to pass its path using the `--main-pack` option.

```
# Using your own exported binary.
./name_of_your_godot_game.ext --main-pack "/path/to/the/pck/file.pck"

# Using the export template binaries from this repository.
./godot_x.x.x_rpi4_export-template.bin --main-pack "/path/to/the/pck/file.pck"
```

If the game you are trying to run uses GLES3, as the Raspberri Pi doesn't work with GLES3, you'll have to pass the `--video-driver GLES2` parameter.

```
# Using your own exported binary.
# Embedded PCK.
./name_of_your_godot_game.ext --video-driver GLES2
# Independant PCK.
./name_of_your_godot_game.ext --main-pack "/path/to/the/pck/file.pck" --video-driver GLES2

# Using the export template binaries from this repository.
./godot_x.x.x_rpi4_export-template.bin --main-pack "/path/to/the/pck/file.pck" --video-driver GLES2
```
